# Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Description
This project involves the detection of glaucoma from retinal images using a deep learning model based on VGG16. The project includes a web-based application for easy image upload and analysis, built using Gradio.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning with VGG16:** Utilized the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet for glaucoma detection.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Handled using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
- **Web Interface:** Designed with Gradio for seamless image upload and results display.
- **VFI Calculation:** Integrated Visual Field Index calculation for improved prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Gradio**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
